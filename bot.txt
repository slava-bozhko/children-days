Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.

BotFather, [29.01.21 08:49]
Sorry, this username is already taken. Please try something different.

BotFather, [29.01.21 08:56]
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/Karusel_Mariupol_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
